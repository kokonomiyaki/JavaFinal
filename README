Question.java - Created by Zach

Thursday meeting?

Zach: Formatted the rest of the questions. Made minor tweaks to some questions so Q&A format is somewhat similar. ??? marks i have a question about the specific question.

Idea: The way Zach and Wakako formatted the questions, we were thinking of creating a GUI with radio buttons for each answer. We will be 
storing the answers in an array. Before each answer in the text document, we have the index of the array with the correct answer.
